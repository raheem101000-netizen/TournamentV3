Bug Reports & Feature Requests
1. Image URL Input

Issue: I cannot input image URLs into the chat.

Current behavior: I updated my server with image links from the internet, but the app does not accept them.

Question: Does the app support image URLs, or is it limited to local files / camera roll uploads? I also attempted to upload from compute files, did not work either 

2. Message Sending

Issue: Messages are not sending.

Current behavior: When I press Send, a popup appears saying “Message sent”, but the message is not delivered.

Expected behavior: Messages should actually send; the popup is unnecessary.

3. File & Image Upload

Issue: File/image upload in chat does not work.

Current behavior: Clicking the file/image button seems to do nothing — appears to be purely a UI element.

Expected behavior: Clicking the button should allow the user to send files or images.

4. Message Search

Issue: Message search bar does not filter results.

Expected behavior: Typing in the search bar should filter messages in real-time.

5. Group Chat Creation (+ Button)

Issue: The + button for creating group chats does not function.

Expected behavior: Clicking the + button should actually allow the creation of a new group chat.

1. Server Creation – Add Logo & Background Options

Issue: When creating a new server, there is no option to upload a server logo or background.

These options only appear after the server is already created.

Expected behavior:

Users should be able to upload a server logo and server background image during the server creation process, not only afterward.

2. Profile Editing Not Working

Issue: I cannot edit my account profile or change my profile picture.

Expected behavior:

Profile editing should be functional so users can update their profile information and upload a new profile picture.

3. Server Logo Display in "My Servers"

Issue: previously, The server icon shown in the "My Servers" list did not match the image uploaded by the server owner during server creation. Make sure it's connected.

Expected behavior:

The server logo displayed in “My Servers” should always be the same logo the owner uploaded when the server was created.
