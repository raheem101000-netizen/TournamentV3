Issue + Required Fixes (Tournament Registration + Match Chat System)

1. Registration Steps Not Displayed Correctly
When a user signs up for a tournament, the tournament dashboard always uses the first step as the team name, even when that first step isn’t meant to be the team name.
Example:
If the first registration field is “Number of players,” the dashboard incorrectly treats that value as the team name.

This means the dashboard is not correctly understanding which field should represent what.

2. Registration Does Not Link to Real User Accounts
When participants register, the tournament dashboard only shows the information they typed into the form.
It does not show their actual @username from the app.

Because of this, the participant is not being treated as a real user profile.
The organiser cannot:

Click their @username

View their profile popup (with add friend / message / view bio options)

Tag or reference them properly in the system

Right now, registration only stores form data and never connects the participant to their actual user account.

3. This Breaks Match Chat Functionality
When the organiser creates a match:

They select what they think are the participants

A match chat is created

BUT the participants are not actually invited into the match chat

The chat never appears in their Messages inbox

This is likely because the system is trying to invite “form data” instead of real user accounts.
If the system doesn’t know which real users are participating, it can’t send them the match chat.

4. Required Correct Behavior

A. Registration must link to real user accounts
When a user signs up for a tournament, the system must save:

The real user ID

The real @username

Not just the custom text they typed in the form.

B. Organiser dashboard must show:

The participant’s @username

Clickable profile popup (just like Discord)

View profile

Add friend

Send message

View bio

C. Match creation workflow must use real user accounts
When the organiser presses “Create Match,” they should be able to:

Select actual tagged participants (@username)

Press “Create Match Chat”

This automatically invites the real user accounts into the chat

D. Match chat visibility:

Organiser sees the match chat from the tournament dashboard

Participants see the match chat in their Messages inbox as a group chat named “Match Chat”

Everyone can chat in the same thread

Summary for Fix

The core issue is that tournament registration does not connect participants to their actual app accounts.
Fixing this should automatically solve:

Incorrect team names

Missing @usernames

No profile access

Match chats not appearing in inboxes

Participants not receiving chat invitations

The system must connect registration → real user profiles → match creation → match chat delivery.
