1. Tournament Creation Issues
	•	When attempting to create a tournament, the system returns an error. This must be fixed.
	•	The tournament creation form only allows tournaments with a prize amount.
Requirement: Entry fee and prize fields must accept:
	•	Numbers
	•	“FREE” (string)
	•	Zero (0)
	•	“No Prize” option
Organizers must be able to create free tournaments, paid tournaments, and no-prize tournaments.

Current tournament registration only supports prize tournaments and forces organizers to enter a price or number.
This must be changed.

Organizers should have full freedom to type any text or currency format into the Entry Fee and Prize fields.
Do not restrict these fields to numbers only.
	•	Entry Fee: allow any text input (e.g., “FREE”, “$5”, “₦1000”, “Gift Card”, “None”)
	•	Prize Reward: allow any text input as well (e.g., “$200”, “No Prize”, “Sponsor Gift”, “TBA”)

Organizers must have full control over what they write in these fields, without being forced into numeric or preset options.
