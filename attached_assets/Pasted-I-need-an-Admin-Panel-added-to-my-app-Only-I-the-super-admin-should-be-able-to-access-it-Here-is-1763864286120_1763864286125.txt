I need an Admin Panel added to my app.
Only I (the super admin) should be able to access it.
Here is exactly what the Admin Panel needs to include:

1. Achievement Control

I need to see every tournament organizer.

Next to each organizer, I need an ON/OFF switch that controls whether that organizer is allowed to give achievements.

If the switch is OFF → that organizer cannot give achievements anywhere in the app.

If the switch is ON → they can give achievements normally.

I also need the ability to personally give achievements to users or teams.

I need the ability to delete any achievements that were given.

2. User and Organizer Management

I need a list of all users in the app, showing:

username

email

role (player, organizer, admin)

I need the ability to:

ban a user

unban a user

delete a user

change a user’s role (for example: make someone an organizer or remove organizer status)

3. Tournament Management

Inside the admin panel, I need:

a list of all tournaments

the ability to delete any tournament

the ability to freeze/lock a tournament if something goes wrong
(when frozen, nobody can update the tournament until I unlock it)

4. Reports and Customer Service Messages

I need a section that shows:

reports made by users

customer service messages sent by users

I must be able to read and manage both.

5. Content Moderation

I need the ability to delete user-uploaded content, including:

tournament poster images

server images

any other images or media uploaded by users

These actions must only be available to me.

Summary

The admin panel should allow me to control:

who can give achievements

giving and deleting achievements

banning, unbanning, and deleting users

viewing and managing user reports

reading customer service messages

deleting user-uploaded images

deleting and freezing tournaments

seeing all users, along with their username, email, and role

controlling organizer permissions with an ON/OFF switch

Only I should have access to these controls.
