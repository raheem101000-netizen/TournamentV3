I encountered several issues and missing features that need to be addressed:

⸻

1. Tournament Details Not Matching Setup

I created a tournament and posted its poster.
When I opened the details, some of the information did not match what I originally set:
	•	Date, player count, and format were correct
	•	Platform and Region were incorrect and did not display the values I selected during creation

This needs to be fixed so all tournament details show exactly what the organizer entered.

⸻

2. Cannot Edit Server Logo or Background

I am unable to:
	•	Add a server profile logo when creating a server
	•	Add a server background image
	•	Edit or update the server logo/background afterward

Server owners must be able to upload and change both the logo and background at any time.

⸻

3. Poster Image Upload is Zoomed In

When uploading an image for a tournament poster:
	•	The image is automatically zoomed in
	•	I cannot resize, zoom out, or fit the full image

Add an image editor allowing:
	•	Resize
	•	Zoom in/out
	•	Fit-to-frame

So the poster can use the full image properly.

⸻

4. Forced Login Every Time

The app requires me to log in every time I open it.

Add:
	•	Persistent login / Remember me
	•	Save user session unless they manually log out

⸻

5. Game Selection is Too Limited

When creating a server, I attempted to add the game Dragon Ball Z, but it was not available in the preset list.

I want the ability to:
	•	Add any game manually
	•	Use text tags instead of a restricted list

⸻

6. Cannot Edit Profile Picture

I cannot change my profile picture on my account.

Users must be able to upload a new profile image from:
	•	Files
	•	Camera roll

⸻

7. Separate Server Lists

I need two separate sections:
	•	Servers I own
	•	Servers I am a member of

They should not be mixed together.

⸻

8. Direct Message Replies

Inside servers and group chats, I need the ability to:
	•	Tap or hold a message
	•	Reply directly to that specific message, just like Discord’s reply system

This is required for conversation clarity.
