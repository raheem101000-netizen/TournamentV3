I have a consistent issue in the tournament dashboard → match chat (organizer view):

When I create a match chat between two participants (example: Raheem vs Eli),

The system does correctly detect the users

The system does correctly deliver the match chat to their Message inbox

Each participant sees the correct names and avatars

BUT the organizer’s view inside the tournament dashboard shows “unknown” instead of the participant’s actual profile name and avatar

This only happens in the organizer’s match chat UI, not in the participant’s UI.

✔ What this proves

The backend does know the correct user.

I can select “Raheem” and choose him as a participant during match creation.

The backend does correctly link the chat to the right user ID.

Raheem receives the match chat in his inbox.

The participant sees their own name correctly in the chat.

Raheem sees “Raheem”

Eli sees “Raheem”

❌ What is failing

Only the organizer UI fails to display the user’s name and avatar, showing “unknown” instead.

This means:

⚠️ The issue is NOT in the backend

The backend clearly stores the user ID

It correctly routes the match chat

It correctly identifies the participants

It correctly loads the participant’s profile in their own inbox

So the backend is working.

⚠️ The issue is in the FRONTEND of the organizer’s match chat view

Specifically:

The organizer’s match chat component is not fetching the user profile data (username + avatar) from the user ID.

What’s likely happening:

The match chat data contains valid user IDs (correct)

The participant’s app screen uses the correct API to fetch profile data for each user ID (correct)

The organizer’s dashboard uses a different or incorrect API call to fetch user info (incorrect)

That call returns “null” or “undefined” for username/avatar

The UI then displays the fallback placeholder → “unknown” and avatar “U”

🧩 Why it only happens to one participant (e.g., Raheem)

Because the bug is likely tied to:

user IDs fetched in a loop

the order in which participants are loaded

or inconsistent mapping between participant objects and actual user accounts

One participant’s data is probably linked correctly by coincidence, while the other is not fetched properly because:

The frontend isn’t using the correct field (e.g., using form data instead of user profile data)

Or the organizer dashboard is using an out-of-date or incorrect chat data structure

Or the organizer dashboard UI never implemented profile fetching

🛑 Replit saying “backend is fine” is correct

The logic proves that the backend correctly identifies, selects, and routes users.

The ONLY place the failure appears is:

👉 The organizer chat UI is not pulling the real user profile data from the user account service.
✅ What the fix should be

In the tournament dashboard → match chat:

For each message sender, fetch user profile by user ID
(GET /user/{id} or whatever the profile endpoint is)

Replace “unknown” with user.username

Replace the “U” avatar with user.avatar or the auto-generated initials

Ensure the frontend uses the same user lookup logic as the Messages inbox chat UI
